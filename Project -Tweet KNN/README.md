## About the project

This project stemmed from the last assignment in my Machine Learning course, at which point I was my most accomplished in python. 

## The assignment:
- Use a health news twitter account
- Use KNN and Jaccard Distance to group the tweets
- Challenge: Where do you start when the items you're grouping do not have coordinates to measure from? 
- Must be coded in python using a single class as appropriate

## My Submission
The file KNN_tweets.py is my original, unaltered submission. I was fairly proud of this, as the previous two assignments had been difficult to implement fully, and this project I was able to fully grasp and finish to completion. My approach was to make each function in the class do one action, and as you can see, for the most part I succeeded in this. Coming from a non-CS background and having quite a mishmash of coding techniques tossed at me haphazardly with no real "implement code like this to make it easy to read and follow", I know this is one of the areas that I need to focus on across all projects. 

Near the end of the KNN class I start grouping actions into a single function, and my purpose with adding this project to my portfolio is to remedy that. Another issue is that while coding this, I failed to remember that KNN goes until the cluster center does not change anymore. In my submission, I wrote the program to run for a given number of iterations. That will be fixed by the end of my work on this as well. 

## This write up
I will be porting this .py file into a jupyter notebook as I would like to explain each step that is going on thoroughly, and I have the most experience with jupyter notebooks. The code will go from being a single class to having functions as if the notebook is the class. After I fix the issues described above, I will be converting it back to a .py file.
