## Lung Segmentation via MATLAB

This was my first foray into any type of machine learning. 
For my Medical Image Analysis class the final project was to take a set of labeled Mild/Severe Covid Lung images and do something interesting with them. 
Most of the class used KNN segmentation based on the black and white values, which was the most basic technique we used. I wanted to do something different. 
Although I had practically no knowledge, I knew I wanted to use machine learning to segment the lungs, giving me a challenge to overcome. 

The [mathworks page](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/introduction-to-convolutional-neural-networks.html;jsessionid=6d7a648abf565bb66689d5af74b2) explaining Convolutional Neural Networks was my first stop.
Ultimately, I went through almost all of their pages about specifying layers, how to use their image processing tool to segment the lungs, and how to connect the files togather so that I could finish the project. 
At times it was stressful as there wasn't a clear explanation of how to get the file that contained the images segmented by me into the MATLAB code, but I finally stumbled upon how to do it. 

Upon completing the project, with my limited ML knowledge, what I ended up with was about 82% accuracy in segmenting the lung from the rest of the x-ray image. 
At the time, I thought this should be higher. After learning quite a bit more in a course about ML, I look back on this and know that it ended up being a good jumping off moment for what would become a deep desire to use machine learning in my career.
